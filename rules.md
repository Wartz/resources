## 1. - Reddiquette
Follow the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLpktf2jYw) They make for a much nicer community.

  If you have been found to be breaking any of the subs rules either rectify if possible or ensure it does not happen again.

## 3.0 - Catagorisation
Use the correct syntax for post titles: "\[OS][WM/DE] Post Title". An example of this would be "\[Arch][DWM] Obscurity Taco".

* ### 3.1
  If a post title is done incorrectly the post will be deleted because it is impossible to edit them.

* ### 3.2 Mark NSFW submissions as NSFW. The title of the sub does not mean that we accept.
  
  + #### 3.2.1 If your comment links to NSFW content, tag it.

  + #### 3.2.2 NSFW content includes (but is not limited to), hard & soft pornography, gore, and 
  
  + #### 3.2.3 Use the NSFW tag to hide spoilers that may be visible (perhaps from your desktop wallpaper) in the thumbnail, and warn in the title. Similarly, try to avoid using titles which are spoilers.
  
* ### 3.3 Mark original content posts with ""\[OC][Type] Post Title". An example of this would be "\[OC][Icons] Numix Square".




## 5.0 - Moderation
Moderation rules are still being created and so Joshua Fogg reserves the right to add them over the next week without breaking the rules of this constitution. The way it will essentially work is a tiered permissions system with votes needed to go up each level.
