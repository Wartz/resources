# 0.0 - Rules
This is a general expansion on the rules mentioned in the subreddit sidebar. Any breach of these rules will result in the appropriate actions being taken.

## 1.0 - Reddiquette
Follow the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLpktf2jYw) They make for a much nicer community.

### 1.1
Try to make critisism constructive wherever possible.

### 1.2
Be patient toward people asking for help in the appropriate place - we were all there once.

## 2.0 - Content


### 2.1
Emails will not be made public, will not be given to any third party, and will only be seen and used by Joshua Fogg. No exceptions.

### 2.2
Each email you recieve marks the begining of a new session.

### 2.3
You will be emailed once every three days with the result of the previous sessions votes and a link to the new sessions votes.

### 2.4
In your email you will be given a 6 digit hex code to enter at the end of your voting poll. This is your unique ID and is used to identify you in the vote. Do not show this to anyone unless you want to have your votes made for you.

### 2.5
You may cancel your voter membership at any time. Simply do this by emailing your unique ID, alias or name to joshua.h.fogg@gmail.com with the subject line "DP Quit".


## 3.0 - Content
The Democracy Project creates Linux themeing projects, by the users for the users.

### 3.1
All content is licensed under the GPLv3 unless stated otherwise.

### 3.2
The Democracy Project will begin with only one usable "product", the icon theme. This icon theme is a fork of version 1 of the Numix Circle icon theme.

### 3.3
The Democracy Project will begin with three unusable "products". These are a non-existent GTK theme, a non-existent conky collection, and a non-existent wallpaper pack.

### 3.4
The project is only allowed one of each type of project in order to stop duplication of effort.
* **3.4.1** Any wallpapers given to the project must be put in the wallpapers repo.
* **3.4.2** Any conky config's given to the project must be put in the conky repo.

### 3.5
Anyone can propose additional "product" types.
* **3.5.1** Additional product type creation automatically updates the constitution with implied rules.

### 3.6
Corrections may be made without vote. An example would be a symlink that is missing the file type or a document with a spelling error.


## 4.0 - Behaviour
Treat others as you wish to be treated yourself.

### 4.1
Any behaviour found to hatful against another user will result in a session ban with the outcome being decided in the next vote.

### 4.2
Any behaviour found to be intentionally causing damage to the project will result in a session ban with the outcome being decided in the next vote.


## 5.0 - Moderation
Moderation rules are still being created and so Joshua Fogg reserves the right to add them over the next week without breaking the rules of this constitution. The way it will essentially work is a tiered permissions system with votes needed to go up each level.
